        We aim to close the mentoring gap and drive equity through quality
        mentoring relationships for young people. Potential is equally
        distributed; opportunity is not. We activate a movement across sectors
        that is diverse and broad and seeps into every aspect of daily life. We
        are connecting and fueling opportunity for young people everywhere they
        are from schools to workplaces and beyond.
