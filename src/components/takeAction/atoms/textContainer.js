        When you were young, did you know how to study for a test or make plans
        for college? Do you remember wanting your first car or looking for a
        part-time job? Simple things that may seem easy or straightforward to
        you now may be a complete mystery to a young person. 1 in 3 young people
        will grow up without having a mentor – either through a formal mentoring
        program or informally through a family friend or community member –
        leaving them disconnected from a critical resource to help with these
        very things.
