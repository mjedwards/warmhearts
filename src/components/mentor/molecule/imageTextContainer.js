          program provides young people the real life skills they need to

          communities, empower their peers into action, and advocate for the
          power of mentoring. MENTOR is a non-partisan organization that seeks
          to fuel the quantity and quality of mentoring relationships for
          Americaâ€™s young people and to close the mentoring gap.
